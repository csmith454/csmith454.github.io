###I want to write!

#I want to write!
**I want to write.**
*I want to write.*

Excuse my enthusiasm, but I had to try out some of the markdown options that are available to me.  This is the first part of a pseudo-self-contract, where I hope to just keep writing.  I've got a lot bouncing around in this brain o' mine.  The *recent* "summit" between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump yields a lot of good products to cook with, including seven pages of documents not meant for public eyes left on a very public printer.[^1]  The Russian economy is working with an arm behind its back and an I.V. of Chinese trade in who knows how many veins.  

Anyways, I want to write more and I will.  I will build a lovely bed of sources and knowledge.  I will ask more questions of a certain caliber.  I will figure out what that caliber is... but I have been working for 3 hours learning Ruby, HTML, and Liquid to produce this website.
