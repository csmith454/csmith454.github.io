## CREEES funding slashed
# A nice little bit of panic in the morning.

This morning I recieved an email from my department's/center's department head/chair that told of what I had expected for a long time; no Foreign Language scholarships, Title IV funding slashed across the university, and the beginning of the end of a Center that I had looked up to for the better parts of my undergraduate education.  It is a huge loss.  It dramatically changes the landscape of my Graduate university experience.  What happens to CREEES' Agnes Sekowski Fusion Room where my cohort has built community for three weeks now?  

I think the palpable impact of this will center on what faculty and programs I want to align myself with in the future.  At the end of the day, to what extent do I have to follow the life that necessitates an income stable enough to live?  It feels like I have to follow the direction that carries the money, not only in how I survive, but also how I conduct research.  I am curious as to how this affects the LBJ dual degree program; will this push more people towards it as liberal arts funding and support state-wide continues to change (read purposefully erode)  Furthermore, Trump's most recent fiscal bill put aside more than 8 billion dollars for Arctic sea power.  

Ultimately, I am cautioning my panic.  I do not *think* my funding or the next two years is affected by the Center's funding explicitly.  

Ashly and I had a lovely chat last night about the ideological and moral realities of the United States currently brought on by the assassination of Charlie Kirk at a Utah university campus.  At first, I felt happy even at the thought of this cretin no longer being able to conduct young white male ideology like Mozart.  But that reaction was tacitly stymied by a post from the neo-liberal corporate ideologue mother of a friend that called for grace and empathy in responding to his passing.  Why is this the immediate response?  It reeks of fake-niceties that are towed along by Christian ideals.  Kirk literally said that some deaths of gun violence are warranted if we are to maintain a strong second amendment.  Ignorance in the literal face of people who do not possess the same systemic power, but nonetheless are human.  Grace in the (now mangled) face of people who actively work to operationalize the system towards the goal of reactionary, inhumane ideas.  

Feigning ignorance is a super power.
