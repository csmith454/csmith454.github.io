#### A creative piece about voter intimidation

The landscape flattened in front of them. The oppressive weight on both their shoulders visibly lightened. They noted the heading for the residences, and started off.

 “Ivan Alexeivitch, my brother Andrey Sergeiivitch is one of the new engineers that came in February-”

“It will be all the more important to make sure he knows.”

“Yes sir, I even coached him when I saw him at New Years”

“I won’t personally touch him.”

“There would really be no need to monitor him either, yes?

“You know I don’t do the monitoring, besides even if I did I would still monitor him. I have a fifth of my employee support budget to ensure this shit happens, and I intend to use it.”

“I know you have a direct line to the Murmansk office; where it all goes and comes from, the people who do the actually monitoring. Please?”

“Fuck you Misha. I will not put my ass on the line for your smarter little brother.”

“Please, I have cooperated with all the intimidation, compliance monitoring, security assurance, whatever label you want to put on it. You know I am not really worried about the monitoring.”

“Yeah I know what the hell you’re all antsy about to prevent. Fine. I will mention his name the next time I talk with them.”

“Thank you Ivan Sergeiivitch, I am truly in your debt.”

By the time Ivan received his petty thanks, the two had stopped at the front entrance for a ceremonial cigarette. The likes of which served to provide a buzz of separation from the actions that the enforcers were soon to commit. It was a tradition, but it was also as much a ritual and funeral hymn. Anybody looking at them would have only seen two employer’s workhorses who are in debt to those above. 

Ivan recognized all these traditions quite well, but the money was too good. Genya and Ivan were trying for another. Their current only-son, Masha, was at a prestigious boarding school in Murmansk. Genya lived in and loved in their beautiful dacha-style house buried in the Arctic forests near Murmansk that creep over from Finland. He would not live in the residences; that’s no place to raise a family. If the residences were the prison yard, Ivan’s sanctuary was the warden’s second vacation home. It was complete with banya and an ice plunge to go back and forth between. Genya harvested birch tree branches at the end of Spring and all throughout the rest of the year they enjoyed whisking themselves and bathing. He loved their life. 

Masha loved it there too. His father fondly remembered the Summers when he came back into town, and the two would camp under the stars just like Ivan’s own father had done. The Winters were a little less active, but always exciting. Just last March, Masha fell through the ice near the dacha’s stream. He was ice cold. Ivan always grew the flames with ease and patience, but they took on more anguish that time. The hearth overflowed with flame threatening to consume the entire house, but Masha had sucked up the heat and cleansed the house of the icy evil.

“Misha, are you ready?”

He snubbed out his cigarette. It fell and the last exhale of smoke went up towards the smokestack that dropped it. 

Ivan Alexeiivitch stomped his feet as he stepped into the landing, and noted the heat coming from the floor. This was an addition from the previous manager, Semyonevitch. The old braggart left his legacy in tact by adding these industrial snow-melters as a consolation prize for his surfs. It had worked a treat for him as those gas-huffers and surfs who actually used them had given Ivan an evil eye ever since he removed the one by his office on platform C because of the noise. 

Ten minutes later, the two walked out with a bag of contraband: drugs, booze, and porn. Notably, Ivan’s face was flush and his previously white shirt layered under a hi-vis vest was now a light brown shirt layered under a tea-dripping vest. Intimidation for Ivan was simply an upset of the expectations, a retuning of realities, a tightening of the fist around a hand held up in victory. Reducing privileges of the holy few created excellent ripple effects down the line.
